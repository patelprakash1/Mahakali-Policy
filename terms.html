      <h3>Acceptance of terms</h3>
      <p>By accessing or using the Mahakali Textile App, users agree to these Terms and Conditions (“Terms”). If the

          Users must keep credentials confidential and are responsible for all activities under their account.</li>
        <li><strong>Suspension/termination:</strong> We may suspend or terminate access for violations of these Terms,
          suspected fraud, or risks to security, with or without notice, subject to applicable law.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Acceptable use</h3>
      <p>Users agree not to:</p>
      <ul>

      </ul>

      <h3>Software updates</h3>

        constitutes acceptance of updates subject to these Terms.</p>

      <h3>Third-party services</h3>

        third-party content, services, or failures.</p>

      <h3>Disclaimers</h3>
      <p>The App is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis without warranties of any kind. We do not warrant
        uninterrupted or error-free operation or that defects will be corrected.</p>

        consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, data, or business arising from use of the App.
        Aggregate liability is limited to the amount paid (if any) for the App in the 12 months preceding the claim.</p>

      <h3>Indemnity</h3>
      <p>Users and/or the provisioning organization agree to indemnify and hold harmless Mahakali Textile from claims,

        third-party rights.</p>

      <h3>Modifications to Terms</h3>
      <p>We may revise these Terms at any time. Continued use after changes become effective constitutes acceptance.
        Material changes will be communicated in the App or via the administrator.</p>

      <h3>Governing law and disputes</h3>
      <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of India. Disputes are subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located
